# Meals App

This project is a Flutter&Dart application that shows nice recipes to learn, using concepts such as Screen Navigation and pointers.

## Content

Meals App is an App constructed with Flutter&Dart, that runs both on IOS and Android. This app displays different recipes, within different categories, implementing new Flutter&Dart concepts I have learned. Feel free to clone this repository and test this code on a virtual machine. The following items helped me on this production:

- Java Knowledge - If it weren't for Java, I'd pretty much be confused about programming.
- Flutter&Dart - These two miracles from the programming world made me 100% more interest on programming. They surely do miracles.
- VSCode - I have tried several other IDEs, and surely this is the best one.
- Android Virtual Machine - It is astonishing how AVM makes you experience the production of a real app.
- Udemy - Seriously, this is the future of knowledge.
- GitHub - GitHub is a must for all programmers nowadays, my cheers to this website.
- Dillinger - It surely helped me construct this fabulous README file.
